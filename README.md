# DCGAN
This is a **Deep Convolutional General Adversarial Network** built to produce images of numbers from 0 to 9. These are trained from the **MNIST** dataset and our own datasets can also be used. **Pytorch** is used here to create this DCGAN and the progress is visualized through **Tensorboard**. 

You can also run this in **Google Colab**, but place DCGAN_model.py file in the main folder of your Google Colab. The Hyperparameters are from the DCGAN paper [**Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434).
